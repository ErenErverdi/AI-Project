Business Impact & Implementation:

1)Expected Operational Improvements:
AI-based dead stock risk prediction system will provide measurable improvements in operational processes.

- Since risky products are identified early, stock planning is done more accurately.
- Unnecessary storage time is reduced.
- Adjustment of supply quantities is achieved more evenly.

2)Cost-Benefit Analysis:
The cost–benefit analysis shows that the proposed AI solution provides high operational savings and financial gains compared to the low development cost.

Costs:
- AI model development and integration costs
- Data collection and data cleaning process
- Dashboard and alert system development
- Team training costs

Benefits:
- Reduction in dead stock
- Savings in warehouse space
- Cost reductions in purchasing units through better demand forecasting
- Savings in operating hours through automatic reporting

3)Customer Experience Benefits:
AI solutions not only provide operational benefits but also significant improvements in the customer experience:

-Increased product availability
- Speeds up operational flow by eliminating unnecessary product clutter in the warehouse
- More accurate pricing
- Increased user confidence
- Cleaner inventory data for better recommendation algorithms

4)Implementation Challenges & Solutions:
Data scarcity / corrupted data:
- In e-commerce companies, SKU (stock keeping unit) history may not always be clean. 
Solution: Create a data cleansing pipeline and use imputation techniques for missing data.

Cross-department integration:
- Purchasing, warehouse, and marketing processes need to work together seamlessly.
Solution: Provide API-based integration and develop a common dashboard for all teams to use.

Model accuracy concerns:
- Inaccurate predictions can negatively impact operations.
Solution: Establish A/B testing, regular model retraining, and performance monitoring mechanisms.

User adoption:
- It can take time for teams to gain confidence in AI output.
Solution: Offer training programs and a demo environment.

5)Return on Investment Projection:
The AI-supported dead stock prediction system provides financial returns in a short time after implementation.

Estimated 1-Year ROI (Return on Investment):
Dead stock reduction: 20–35%
Annual storage cost savings: 10–18%
Reduction in losses due to promotions and discounts: 20–30%
Operational labor efficiency: 8–12% automation savings
Estimated annual ROI (Return on Investment): 120–200%

Based on these projections, the system fully pays for itself within the first year and transforms the company into more efficient.
