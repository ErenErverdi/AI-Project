HOW DOES IT WORK? :
The proposed AI system is designed to detect the "dead stock" problem encountered in e-commerce businesses at an early stage, highlight risky products, and develop appropriate strategies. The system generates a Dead Stock Risk Score for each product and determines which products are at risk of not being sold in the future.

1)Data Collection and Feature Engineering:
Sales records, inventory levels, pricing and discount history, product attributes, and user behavior data are collected from multiple sources. These datasets transformed into meaningful features that can be used as model inputs. Such as:
Sales velocity
Stock age
Click-through rate (CTR)
Add-to-cart but not purchased rate
Seasonality or period information
Discount history

2)Predictive Modeling and Risk Score Generation:
Machine learning models analyze patterns in historical data to predict the likelihood of a product becoming discontinued. For each SKU, the model generates a Dead Stock Risk Score between 0 and 1. The higher the score, the higher the risk of the product becoming dead stock.

3)Decision Support and Automatic Actions:
The scores produced by the model are evaluated by a decision engine that supports strategic decisions:

Highlights risky products
Suggests dynamic pricing/discounts
Generates special coupons for customers
Alerts category managers
Triggers a "small-lot stocking" strategy for new products
This increases operational efficiency and significantly reduces dead stock.

AI/ML Techniques Used:

1)Supervised Learning Models:
These models predict the likelihood of products going unsold in the future by looking at past sales and inventory data.
-Random Forest
-XGBoost
-Logistic Regression (baseline model)
These models provide both high accuracy and ease of understanding for business units because they can explain feature importance.

2)Time Series Forecasting Models:
-LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or Prophet
-Effective for predicting future sales trends
-Useful for detecting seasonal patterns and sudden demand changes

3)Reinforcement Learning (Optional Advanced Phase):
-Can optimize discount strategies based on customer response
-Learns which incentive level maximizes sales with minimum margin loss

4)Recommendation Algorithms:
-Personalized advertising and coupon targeting
-Collaborative filtering or deep learning–based recommendation models
-Helps display high-risk items to the right customers

Data Requirements:
The system requires a combination of sales, behavioral, and product metadata to ensure accurate predictions.
1)Sales & Inventory Data
Historical sales quantity (daily/weekly)
Stock levels and stock age
Sell-through rate
Price changes and discounts
Return rates

2)Product Information
Category, brand, seasonality
Product type
Release date
Cost and profit margin

3)Customer Interaction Data
Page views, click-through rate
Add-to-cart but not purchased events
Bounce rate
Conversion rate
Customer segmentation

4)Operational & Supply Chain Data
Supplier lead times
Delivery delays
Warehouse handling time
Packaging or restocking costs

These data points enable the model to detect which products are slowing down, losing relevance, or failing to convert browsing customers into buyers.
