What is DeadStock
Dead stock consists of products that do not generate sales within a reasonable time. These items accumulate in warehouses, create unnecessary storage costs, and often need to be sold through discounts or disposed of entirely.

Why Is It a Critical Problem?

Storage Costs: Unsold items continue to take warehouse space, it increase 

Cash Flow Disruption: Products that do not sell prevent capital from circulating efficiently.

Operational Inefficiency: Managing slow-moving inventory complicates daily operations.

Discount Losses: Companies frequently apply heavy discounts to liquidate stagnant products.
